# Preparing the Data

## Collect Data

Gather your training data and place it in a directory. Your data should be in a format that the [train.py](https://github.com/changcheng967/Kata_speed/blob/main/train.py) script can process (e.g., SGF files for Go games).

## Organize Data

Organize your data in the following structure:

data/ train/ game1.sgf game2.sgf … test/ test_game1.sgf test_game2.sgf …


## Configuring the Script

### Modify [train.py](https://github.com/changcheng967/Kata_speed/blob/main/train.py)

Open the [train.py](https://github.com/changcheng967/Kata_speed/blob/main/train.py) script in a text editor and customize the following parameters according to your needs:

- **Data Paths**: Set the paths to your training and testing data.
- **Training Parameters**: Adjust parameters such as learning rate, batch size, number of epochs, etc.
- **Model Parameters**: Define the architecture of the model you wish to train.

Example snippet from [train.py](https://github.com/changcheng967/Kata_speed/blob/main/train.py):

python
# Set data paths
train_data_path = 'data/train/'
test_data_path = 'data/test/'

# Training parameters
learning_rate = 0.001
batch_size = 32
num_epochs = 100

# Model parameters
input_shape = (9, 9, 1)  # For a 9x9 Go board

Running the Script
Execute train.py by opening a terminal or command prompt, navigating to the directory containing train.py, and running the following command:

`python train.py`

The script will read your data, initialize the model, and begin training. You will see output related to training progress, loss values, and other metrics.

Monitoring Training
TensorBoard
If you have enabled TensorBoard logging in the train.py script, you can monitor your training process by running:

`tensorboard --logdir=logs/`

Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:6006/ to see the training metrics and graphs.

Saving and Evaluating the Model
Model Checkpointing
The script is set to save the best model during training based on validation performance. Checkpoints will be saved in the specified directory.

Evaluate the Model
After training, you can evaluate your model using the test data to check its performance.

Customization
Feel free to modify the train.py script further to suit your specific needs. You can change the model architecture, add more advanced data preprocessing steps, or implement custom evaluation metrics.
